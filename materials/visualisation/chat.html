Slides are in https://vedph.github.io/summercamp/materials/visualisation/Xslt_short.pptx
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella

XML <num>15</num>

is transformed into

HTML <span class="nr">15</span>
Then CSS says: all HTML <span> elements that have class="nr" must be shown in red
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:20</strong><br/>
This can be achieved by means of many programming languages (I mostly use JavaScript or Python), but XSLT has been created specificall for that task
</p><hr/><p>

As a general comment: from XML to HTML we are actually losing information. It's a presentational layer: many things get the same appearance. E.g. a person name or a place name can both just become italic; and italic it's just that: italic. Representation is much richer and for XML we have several dialects for each specific conceptual domain.

All materials
...including the final XML to use
are in https://vedph.github.io/summercamp/materials/visualisation/
Please go there and download all materials
Direct link to the GItHub folder with the materials: https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
please download all files in the github folder

if you want to preserve as much information as possible in a transformation, you must re-arrange the information; for exmaple, the name of an XML tag can become the class of a HTML tag: XML-TEI <persName><forename>Federico</forename></persName> becomes, in HTML, <span class="persName"><span class="forename">Federico</span></span>

I never get how to download files from github
</p><hr/><p>
Valentina MIGNOSA
<strong>11:27</strong><br/>
me too
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:27</strong><br/>
1) Download everything in https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
2) open with double click on transform.xpr
</p><hr/><p>
Chloé Tardivel
<strong>11:27</strong><br/>
me too
</p><hr/><p>
Gaia Tomazzoli
<strong>11:27</strong><br/>
ok, it's on google drive
but since we're here
</p><hr/><p>
Janyce Desiderio
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
I'm not sure you can download from github if you don't have an account
</p><hr/><p>
Gaia Tomazzoli
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
would it be possible to explain how to download from github?
</p><hr/><p>
Janyce Desiderio
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
(it's not a sure affirmation ...)
</p><hr/><p>
VeDPH - unive
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
if you just transform <persName><forename>Federico</forename></persName> in <span><span>Federico</span></span> you lose information
</p><hr/><p>
Sara Ayres
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
If I may ask Tiziana, how much time should you add to a transcription and translation project of 15,000 words for coding? 
</p><hr/><p>
Daniele FUSI
<strong>11:28</strong><br/>
#All: ensure to download ALL the files, and put them in the SAME folder. The resulting HTML has some dependencies (CSS and JS), which are to be found in the same directory.
</p><hr/><p>
Janyce Desiderio
<strong>11:29</strong><br/>
(otherwise you clone the repository)
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:29</strong><br/>
OK done
Now it's a zip file
step by step:
1) go to https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
2) right click → download as / save as
3) unzip it

Two documents are isomorphic if exists a transfromation from A to B and a reverse transforamtion form B to A, without loss of information.
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:30</strong><br/>
4) click on transform.xpr
</p><hr/><p>

Chloé Tardivel
<strong>11:32</strong><br/>
all clear thanks !
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
If you don't have 'save as', do 'save link' from GitHub
</p><hr/><p>
Valentina MIGNOSA
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
yes
</p><hr/><p>
Chloé Tardivel
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
yes
</p><hr/><p>
Christian D'Agata
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
yes
</p><hr/><p>
Janyce Desiderio
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
yes
</p><hr/><p>
Michele Sollecito
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>
yes
</p><hr/><p>
Silvia Gazzoli
<strong>11:34</strong><br/>

Y. Faghihi
<strong>11:38</strong><br/>
Could you just show the next step as well..again 
</p><hr/><p>
Valentina MIGNOSA
<strong>11:38</strong><br/>
do we have to select 'Transformation options'?
</p><hr/><p>
Y. Faghihi
<strong>11:38</strong><br/>
I mean the visualisation
</p><hr/><p>
Daniele FUSI
<strong>11:38</strong><br/>
Open the XML and then pick Document/Transformation/Configure Transformation Scenario just click apply no option required
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:38</strong><br/>
I added a sub-folder in the github with the same files unzipped, just in case you have issues with the ZIP file https://github.com/vedph/event_materials/tree/master/2020_summer_camp/strand_1_text/visualisation
</p><hr/><p>
Daniele FUSI
<strong>11:39</strong><br/>
BTW The warning appearing after applying is a developer's commodity to make sure he did not forget to match some tags from the TEI document by mistake. "Forgetting" a text node here is OK, because a text node is copied by default as it is.
</p><hr/><p>
Gaia Tomazzoli
<strong>11:40</strong><br/>
didn't they cancel the Redentore?
maybe just the fireworks?
we don't hear it
</p><hr/><p>
Sara Ayres
<strong>11:43</strong><br/>
is it possible to have two IIF images from different sources on the same page, to facilitate comparison? 
Yes in the presentation :-)

Thanks for this link!

Daniele FUSI

Also but take into account that a web presentation targets multiple devices and usually this means we must be prepared to face dramatically different screen sizes. There are ways to provide different CSS rules for different media anyway, that's called responsivity.

I have a very specific question about the semantic web. let's assume that I have a database of inscriptions formed by single epigraphic records and that in these cards there are drop-down menus with standardized items (e.g. supports: vase, stele, etc.). Can I use what Professor Mancinelli showed us to insert my entries with reference to other entries on the web?
</p><hr/><p>
Paolo Monella
<strong>11:46</strong><br/>
Alberto's answer pertains to an individual wanting to see two images vis-a-vis; my answer pertains to the webpage of your scholarly digital edition linking text & image
